## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. 

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Accuracy
  * Precision
  * Recall scores
* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Accuracy
  * Precision
  * Recall scores

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:

* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
